  <h3>Background</h3>
  <div class="summary">
    <p>A little about myself for those who are interested: I am half Filipino and half Chinese, I was born in Fremont, CA but spent most of my life in Pleasanton, CA and I spent most of my time growing up playing sports like soccer and lacrosse as well as hanging out with my friends playing video games. In particular, lacrosse has allowed me to travel to many different parts of the US to compete in large tournaments in Denver, Maryland, and Delaware. I am very grateful for that opportunity as I wouldn't have gotten the chance to go to these places without the playing sport. It was actually during one of my lacrosse trips to Oregon with my highschool team where I grew an interest in my future undergraduate school, the University of Oregon.</p>
    <p>Living in Eugene, OR was quite the experience as the weather was pretty different from California but I learned to appreciate living in a state that had real seasons. I also had the opportunity to play in a Men's Lacorsse League for Hop Valley Brewing co. where I am glad that I was able to continue playing at a high level, travel along the Pacific Northwest, and meet some great teammates. At the University of Oregon, I double majored in Computer Science and Psychology where I started my love for coding. Even though it may be an unconventional pairing of majors I believe that there can be strong benefits to the world by learning about both of these fields of studies. After obtaining my BS in 2017, I moved back home to the Bay Area and started working immediately where I started my MS in Computer Science with a focus in Human-Computer Interaction at DePaul University as a part-time student alongside working full time. Since then I have been trying my best to improve myself everyday whether in my studies or learning a new skill.</p>

  <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
  <div class="summary">
    <P>I have numerous hobbies and interests that I spend most of my free time thinking and researching about, but the 2 main hobbies that have occupied a majority of my thoughts (and money) are Sneakers and Super Smash Bros Melee.</P>
    <p>I have a very strong interest in sneakers as I am always looking for the next release and chasing after the grail that I would have to spend ridiculous amounts of money to attain. My love for shoes started around the end of high school and really grew strong in college where I went to the University of Oregon and witnessed an abundance of incredibly nice shoes from the student athletes and my other classmates. This really pushed me to learn more about shoes since the University of Oregon is where Nike was started and learned about the culture and history. From there, I got a part-time job to afford my addiction for nice shoes and my collection has grown immensely since then. I have gotten extremely lucky and was able to purchase some very hyped shoes for retail and I have had to bite the bullet and pay a resale price for shoes that I really wanted. Of course with nice shoes, there also comes an interest in streetwear where buying hyped clothes is just as frustrating and stressful as buying limited shoes. Having an interest in hyped clothes and fashion has not been kind to my wallet as well. Overall, I am really glad I got into this hobby because it taught me some money management skills and different ways to achieve your goals.</p>
    <p>My other hobby is competing in Super Smash Bros Melee tournaments where I have created many friendships and fond memories. For those unfamiliar with the Smash Bros franchise, it is a very popular fighting game that spans numerous Nintendo consoles. I specifically compete in the version for the Nintendo Gamecube, Super Smash Bros Melee. I first started going to tournaments in college and have never looked back. Competing in this game is so addicting especially going to tournaments with friends and discussing ways to get better with them and other competitors. The game is very technical and moves very fast so performing certain button inputs takes a lot of practice and determination. I usually practice about 30 min a day just basic technical inputs and combos everyday just so that I do not get rusty. There is also the factor of outhinking your opponent which I enjoy a lot as well. When playing a good opponent it can sometimes feel like I am playing an insanely fast game of chess which is what pushes me so much to be even better. This hobby of competing in tournaments has helped me to enforce a strong work ethic as well as instill the mindset of "practice makes perfect" and its philosophies have carried over to my personal, educational, and professional life as well.</p>
